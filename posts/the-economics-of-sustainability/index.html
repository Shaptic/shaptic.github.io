        <p>This will be a semi-organized rant that loosely ties together history, economics, philosophy, ethics, and environmentalism. We&rsquo;ll look at the rise of capitalism alongside industrialization and its unparalleled economic growth, but then analyze its cost on our hopes for a healthy, sustainable society.</p>

# Outline

1. Capitalism and the 20th century
  - unparalleled carbon footprint
  - redundancy
2. The Soviet economy
  - one product to rule them all
  - efficiency, uniformity, best for the people not for $


# Introduction

What is capitalism? If we rely on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) (ironically, a non-profit platform), we get the following definition:

> Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.

The meaning is simple: profit is reserved for individuals, not the government.

While the Second Industrial Revolution is commonly considered to have begun in the United States in the late 1700s (with Samuel Slater's emigration from Britain carrying industrial trade secrets), I will instead start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in which things really started to take off, like after the 1859 invention of the internal combustion engine.[^1]

This will set the stage for the foundations of the true problem: **late-stage capitalism**. Now, this is admittedly an overloaded term, so I'll define it in a particular, succinct way: the last 30 years of Western capitalism.

Then, I'll examine the "true cost" of this era of progress and consumption.
-->
<h1 id="economic-development">Economic Development</h1>
<p>The Industrial Revolution, fueled by capitalism, has undoubtedly made a subset of humanity better off in the short-term. Even the simplest products are luxuries no one before us has ever even come <em>close</em> to seeing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">We take it for granted today, but a single Dorito has more extreme nacho flavor than a peasant in the 1400s would get in his whole lifetime.</p>
  
    <p class="quote-attribution">
      &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewpcrowley/status/621078253827002368?lang=en">@MatthewPCrowley</a>
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a corollary to this tweet: a <strong>bag</strong> of Doritos has more extreme nacho flavor than the wealthiest king in the 1400s would get in a single meal.</p>
<h2 id="growth--prosperity">Growth &amp; Prosperity</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, the average salary in the United States was around \$750/year,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> working out to \$21,500/year today after adjusting for inflation. The average salary today, though, is more than double that at \$53,400/year. Even if you use the median salary, its still $34,600/year, a 61% increase.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Whether or not this is an <em>appropriate</em> rise given the productivity increases in that same period (a measly 115% compensation growth vs. a contrasting 253% productivity growth since 1950)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is a separate issue: there&rsquo;s still a strong argument to be made that things are better now than they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>We have an encyclopedia of human knowledge available in our pockets; the flavors and cuisines of the entire world are ever-present in our grocery stores; we can communicate over thousands of miles in seconds and travel there ourselves in hours; etc. We can write and print books, take stunning photographs, record high-quality videos, and consume media created around the world without moving anything but our thumbs.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, capitalism and industrialization brought us a lot of luxury.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only the First World that&rsquo;s benefitted, either. The amount of people living below the poverty line has dropped ~75% since 1990,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and the people there generally live better than they did last century:</p>

<p>To put it succinctly, the numbers appear good, regardless of location.</p>
<p>And yet, there&rsquo;s no way it can be all sunshine and roses. This kind of hedonism and excess is obviously delightful in the moment, but what does it mean for humanity beyond instant gratification? Specifically, what does it mean for the portion of humanity that continues to enjoy <em>more excess</em> rather than <em>newfound</em> excess?</p>
<p>There must be a cost.</p>

<h2 id="statistical-sleight-of-hand">Statistical Sleight-of-Hand</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s analyze the underlying truth of these feel-good statistics: we should be extremely skeptical of feel-good justifications for a system that are the product of said system. It&rsquo;s like when pharmaceutical companies fund research about the benefits of&hellip; pharmaceuticals. So let&rsquo;s analyze the &ldquo;developments&rdquo; we just talked about.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">There are lies, damned lies, and statistics.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First, notice Matt&rsquo;s particular choice of words: &ldquo;the poor doubled their <strong>consumption</strong>.&rdquo; Well, why is that necessarily a good thing? Where are the measures of, say, happiness and life satisfaction, ecological diversity, or light pollution?</p>
<!-- How often do we camp in the woods, look up at the stars, and wonder if we really need all of the crap we've burdened ourselves with during our "consumption". -->
<p>Second, notice the generality of these claims: &ldquo;the average human,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Chinese,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the average salary&rdquo; are all on a scale that makes manipulating numbers far too easy. While it appears that nations are better off <strong>as a whole</strong>, this notion often breaks down if you look deeper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a contradiction (or, rather, a <em>deep</em> mislead) <strong>within the quote itself</strong>.</p>
<p>How do you compute the average human lifespan? Do you do it naively with the arithmetic mean? For example,
$$
\frac{1 + 70 + 67 + 20 + 82 + 0 + 1}{7} \approx 34.4
$$</p>
<p>The average here is 34 years, but obviously that&rsquo;s not representative of what actually happens in this society: most people either die <em>really</em> young or reach old age. The median isn&rsquo;t much better: &ldquo;20&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t give you the full picture.</p>
<p>Following this logic, then, if the average human buries two-thirds fewer children, the average lifespan <em>must increase by definition</em>:
$$
\frac{1 + 70 + 67 + 20 + 82 + 68 + 55}{7} \approx 51.9
$$</p>
<p>As you can see, turning the child deaths to normal lifespans leads to a nearly 20-year increase to the average lifespan.</p>
<p>So this follow-up claim that the Chinese &ldquo;live about 25 years longer,&rdquo; does not necessarily mean that lifespans increased. It implies that humans used to live to 50 and die, and now they live to 75. The statistics are presented as independent benefits: we live longer AND less babies die. However, this is misleading: when less children die in childbirth, the average lifespan naturally goes up massively.</p>
<p>And even despite all of this anyway, the decrease in childhood mortality can&rsquo;t even be attributed to capitalism or prosperity, but simply to hygiene.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The misdirect goes well beyond this specific example. In general, statistics of economic prosperity sound like a promising attestation to the &ldquo;side effects&rdquo; of capitalism: industrializing a nation benefits everyone within it as well as the nations that provide the materials and labor it needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it continues to be a simple manipulatation:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">[We] openly discussed the deceptive nature of [Gross National Product]. For instance, GNP may show growth even when it profits only one person, such as an individual who owns a utility company, and even if the majority of the population is burdened with debt. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Yet, from a statistical standpoint, this is recorded as economic progress.</p>
  
    <p class="quote-attribution">
      &mdash; John Perkins, <em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em>
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>The subtle lies run even deeper than that, usually perpetuated by the very people that benefit from them. Perkins continues:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem"><p>My staff of economists, financial experts, [&hellip;] proved that that such investments — in electric power systems, highways, ports, airports, and industrial parks — would spur economic growth.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>The statistics were highly biased; they were skewed to the fortunes of the families that owned the industries, banks, shopping malls, supermarkets, hotels, and a variety of other businesses that prospered from the infrastructure we built.</p>
<p>They prospered.</p>
<p>Everyone else suffered.</p>
<p>Money that had been budgeted for health care, education, and other social services was diverted to pay interest on the loans.</p>
</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>The development, prosperity, and growth; the feel-good indicators of success; and the endless supply of trinkets and goodies are just a masqueraded product of economic imperialism. The developed nations (well, mostly just the U.S.) put economic shackles on developing nations and hide the chains under a statically-backed façade of progress.</p>
<h2 id="workers-rights">Workers&rsquo; Rights</h2>
<p>Even throughout the growth, for those lucky enough to experience it, there were still steep costs. The working class in developed nations had to fight tooth and nail for every safety law (there were 35,000 factory deaths/year in 1900<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>), labor regulation (remember child labor, the lack of minimum wage, or the fact that women couldn&rsquo;t work?), and benefit (pensions took hold in 1920, and employer-provided health insurance didn&rsquo;t exist before the 1940s) relinquished by the industrialists.</p>
<p>People forget that the 40-hour work week and minimum wage are both less than 100 years old and are the product of strong unions and collective bargaining by the working class.</p>
<p>Their struggle still continues: it doesn&rsquo;t take long to find tons of supporting evidence that the economic power of a single job or single dollar is <a href="https://medium.com/@aaronmhill/minimum-wage-vs-cost-of-living-e6b1257b6bba">dwindling</a> relative to what it used to be, and the fight for workers&rsquo; rights is as relevant as ever today as ever before: Hyundai <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-hyundai-subsidiary-has-used-child-labor-alabama-factory-2022-07-22/">got caught</a> using child labor <strong>last month</strong>, and Pinkertons are back to union-busting.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In reality, all we did was outsource the unregulated exploitation of the working class to developing nations that can&rsquo;t fight back, but that&rsquo;s beside the point: economic progress neither painless nor free.</p>
<h2 id="duplication-of-labor">Duplication of Labor</h2>
<p>Under capitalism&rsquo;s necessity of hyperspecialization, we see an excess of waste and repetition in regards to human labor.</p>
<p>How many tire manufacturers are making the same rubber donuts with tiny variations in design and quality?</p>
<p>How many car manufacturers have production lines for steering wheels that have tiny, superficial, aesthetic variations among each other?</p>
<p>How many phone manufacturers are repackaging the same chipsets with their own minor form factor tweaks to the hardware and spamware tweaks to the software? How much of the e-waste generated by getting a new phone every few years<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> could be eliminated by putting fragmented minds together to create something truly great?</p>
<p>How many software engineers have spent their time creating sign-up forms and date pickers whose collective variations could be replicated by a single engineer tweaking an open source project? How many different word processors, image viewers, login forms, streaming platforms, video players, or social networks do we need?</p>
<p>How many factories out there are dedicated just to making <em>plastic bags</em>? You know, the ones that tear on your way to the car, that saturate the sky on a windy day in any city, that kill 100,000 marine animals every year?<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">entire book</a> dedicated to the idea that there are people out there completely wasting away doing work that is meaningless and superfluous. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a> is a known (and probably encouraged) phenomenon that makes this worse.</p>
<p><strong>What the fsck are we doing?</strong> Participating in collective insanity, apparently: we&rsquo;ve applied Einstein&rsquo;s definition<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> on a <strong>global</strong> scale. Millions of man-hours and an immeasurable amount of natural resources spent doing the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>WHY?</strong></span></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how absurd this concept is. At any given moment, there are probably thousands of people out designing the <strong>exact same thing</strong> for corporations that are in competition with each other. If you put them all in the same room, there&rsquo;s absolutely no doubt in my mind that you&rsquo;d get a better product by simple virtue of the fact that you wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting labor on the same task.</p>
<p>This duplication of labor and resources segues cleanly into the next cost of economic prosperity: climate change.</p>
<h2 id="climate-change">Climate Change</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Capitalism encourages innovation through competition.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take this as truth for the sake of argument. Then there&rsquo;s a follow-up nobody seems to ask: at what point should we <strong>stop</strong> encouraging innovation? When we will decide that we have enough?</p>

# Economics Under Socialism

To borrow from Lenin (with a bit of tongue-in-cheek), we need to ask ourselves: "What is to be done?"

## Humanistic Product Development

## Function Over Form

The AK-47 is undoubtedly one of the greatest innovations in 20th-century weaponry. The final design is an engineering marvel: with only eight moving parts, unparalleled reliability under all conditions, and simplicity in operation, it could mass-produced quickly and cheaply. To this day, despite being 40+ years out of date, there are still millions of them in use for those same reasons.[^24]

While it's true that capitalism breeds efficiency in the sense that if a niche is present, either a nimble neighbor of the niche will adapt or a newcomer will take hold, a functional economy (by that I mean one that prefers function over form) has a similar level of adaptability

Within two months, workshops that previously built railway cars had switched to production of tanks.

<p>It seems capitalism is both a blessing and a curse: on one hand, we get unforeseen technological advancement and social mobility for the lucky ones; on the other hand, we get moral, nutritional, and environmental degeneracy at the behest of the profit motive, not to mention the spread of poverty, starvation, and suffering for the fuel powering the capitalism regime: the unlucky ones.</p>
<!-- Socialism faces the opposite problem: on one hand, societal cooperation and humanist innovation; on the other hand, shortages, conformity, and economic rigidity.
 -->
<!-- There's an easy answer for this: because capitalism's incentives are morally bankrupt and we couldn't trust any single entity to actually do a good job of this.  -->
<p>To borrow from Lenin (with a bit of tongue-in-cheek), we need to ask ourselves: &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given the existential risks, this might be the <strong>only</strong> thing worth pondering.</p>
