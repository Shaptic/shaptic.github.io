Further still, &lsquo;democracy&rsquo; spreads worldwide as a term masking economic imperialism.

        <p>It seems to me that the world is ripe and ready for a rude awakening. The events that have transpired over the last few months&mdash;from the COVID-19 lockdowns to the George Floyd protests&mdash;have hopefully opened the eyes of many to the possibility that freedom in our seemingly-democratic nation is merely an illusion that only exists for as long as it&rsquo;s convenient.</p>

  This post is obviously an opinion piece: I&rsquo;m not a constitutional lawyer, a historian, or even a journalist. I could be off-base, misinformed, or straight up wrong about some of the things I present here.

<h1 id="on-the-bill-of-rights">On the Bill of Rights</h1>
<p>In this post, I want to tear apart the Constitutional protections &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; to us by the Founding Fathers one by one with clear evidence outlining how they are ceremonial at best. My fundamental thesis is that the core amendments&mdash;our Bill of Rights&mdash;are only upheld for the theatrics of democracy: they present a comforting façade that crumbles as soon as it&rsquo;s convenient for the government to ignore them.</p>
<p>The upside, of course, is that we get to enjoy said rights. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> happy to be able to speak freely, buy a gun, and get a lawyer. The goal of this post is mostly to highlight that those rights are never, by any stretch of the imagination, &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="amendment-i">Amendment I</h2>
<p>The full text of the First Amendment is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in 18th century English, the meaning is pretty clear: the rights to <strong>peaceful assembly</strong> shall not be infringed. What do you call, then, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn6pAOIjgQg">30 minute compilation</a> of police beating non-violent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> protestors? An isolated incident? How about when this march in 2014 led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVmyMKtmwU4">students being beaten</a>? Just a recent phenomenon? Nope, it&rsquo;s been happening since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtOKIECgxs">at least</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/smx-Sk3PzzI?t=440">60s</a>. Purely a product of racism, then? Not exactly, since we can see the <a href="https://www.nsfwyoutube.com/watch?v=9eOmKyS7Wik">same</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRwIVnUAr2o">things</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AutSKodyeso">happening</a> during the Occupy movement. I could go on and on&hellip; Fundamentally, if you are assembling to advocate for meaningful change, you will be shut down if you push the wrong buttons.</p>
<p>Surely the <strong>freedom of the press</strong> is safe, then? Totally, as long as you ignore police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN8ISwuiX68">beating</a>, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/06/21/journalists-phone-hacked-by-new-invisible-technique-all-he-had-to-do-was-visit-one-website-any-website.html">hacking</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da_X-u0CsQQ">arresting</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-protests-reporters-press-teargas-arrested">journalists</a> as they see fit. <!-- (to what end? information suppression? intimidation? dominance? all of the above?) --> And the fact that one corporation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI">controls</a> 40% of the local news market. And that the CIA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">actively subverts</a> free media expression. And the fact that another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_News_Corp#News_&amp;_Magazines_(digital_and_print)">two</a> <a href="https://bigthink.com/stephen-johnson/here-are-all-the-companies-att-time-warner-will-own-after-the-merger-2">corporations</a> dominate remaining chunk of &ldquo;free&rdquo; journalistic expression. Obviously more-independent media exists, but it&rsquo;s undeniable that a handful of networks provide information to a large-enough portion of the populace that it can influence &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; outcomes. To me, that just sounds like state-run propaganda with extra steps.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The problem is pervasive goes all the way to the top: journalists in charge of keeping our leaders in check can arbitrarily have their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/court-white-house-press-passes-144848">press passes revoked</a>.</p>
<!-- Okay, so things don't look great. The final bastion of **freedom of speech** is safe, though, right? Well, not really...  -->
<!-- Most of our communication and interactions during the modern day happen over the Internet (especially so during the COVID-19 lockdowns). Are we really able to speak our mind when the court of public opinion can essentially end liberty and property on a whim? People say "freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences," but this red herring is conveniently echoed only by those *imposing* said consequences. The notion that one man's opinion could be instantly (and permanently) broadcast to the world could not have been predicted by the Founding Fathers; even in the modern era, this was unheard of prior to the dominance of impersonal social media platforms like Twitter. Vocal minorities now hold complete and impenetrable control over speech; its freedom is a farce.

In some ways, the issues plaguing the freedom of speech are the same ones hurting the press: journalists are simply [afraid to publish](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself) pieces and people are simply [afraid to express](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23635384) themselves; the risk of "wrongthink" (which of course fluctuates from day to day and person to person) permanently hovers over our heads. -->
<p>One could argue about the relative importance of each amendment, but regardless of the ordering, the dissolution of every facet of the First Amendment does not bode well for the idea that our rights have any sort of legal guarantee when facing pressure. Onward&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="amendment-ii">Amendment II</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll gloss over the fact that a well-regulated militia doesn&rsquo;t exist (some argue that the National Guard fulfills this role) and focus on the <strong>right to bear arms</strong>. I don&rsquo;t want to go all NRA in this section (though note their ironic silence during the current protests), but it should be obvious to anyone that the current state of firearm ownership is far and away from the intent of the amendment. Whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or not is a different story; the point still stands. Let&rsquo;s not forget that the rich employ private security to keep them safe; these forces are equipped far better than even the most die-hard 2nd Amendment fan. Isn&rsquo;t this yet another case in which the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; rules don&rsquo;t apply to the wealthy?</p>

## Amendment III
I'll skip this one (it bans housing soldiers) because it's largely not applicable in modern times, but it's worth noting that it has never been infringed. Of course, the U.S. has also never faced war on its own soil, so maybe that's simply a product of there never being a reason or opportunity to disregard it...
 -->
<h2 id="amendment-iv">Amendment IV</h2>
<p>Most of the subsequent amendments aim to protect our legal rights in a criminal context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simpler terms, probable cause is required to enact searches that would otherwise be considered unreasonable. And yet, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-frisk_in_New_York_City">stop-and-frisk</a> policy in NYC is almost undeniably the complete antithesis of probable cause, and police literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANRvFNc0hw">plant drugs</a> on people to manufacture &ldquo;cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surveillance is constitutionally considered a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/electronic_surveillance">form of search</a>, and yet, the NSA indiscriminately watches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">all of the Internet traffic</a> in the country and continually builds up a suite of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/">hacking tools</a>, as the pivotal Snowden revelations showed us. Law enforcement performs warrant-less wiretaps on cell phones via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_use_in_United_States_law_enforcement">Stingrays</a> and has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/how-identify-visible-and-invisible-surveillance-protests">an arsenal</a> of other mass surveillance tools that don&rsquo;t require a second thought from a legal perspective. And let&rsquo;s not even talk about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">PATRIOT Act</a> essentially <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act">made judges and warrants unnecessary</a> if the FBI wants to perform extensive surveillance and data gathering on citizens.</p>
<p>In theory, shouldn&rsquo;t this firehose of information make it absurdly easy for law enforcement officers (LEOs) to prevent crimes and apprehend criminals? Au contraire, mon frère. Unless, of course, the state itself is <a href="https://www.fox23.com/news/trending/etsy-review-helps-fbi-track-down-woman-who-set-fire-police-cars/N46HZYITVVD37MGRDE5X4VXUUA/">under attack</a>: then, the government will leverage its arsenal of tools and knowledge to its full potential.</p>
<h2 id="amendment-v">Amendment V</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colloquially, this preserves our right to due process. Crucially, a person must not be deprived of life, liberty, and property throughout it. And yet, the police are allowed to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/asset-forfeiture-abuse">seize property</a> <em>even in the absence of a crime</em>. In fact, we (the people) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/">lose more stuff</a> to civil asset forfeiture than to <em>burglaries</em>.</p>
<p>Deprivation of liberty is discussed in the next section, and I don&rsquo;t even want to talk about being deprived of life&hellip; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_country">statistics</a> speak for themselves. And let&rsquo;s not forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Experiments_on_Americans">government programs</a> that preyed upon &ldquo;people who could not fight back&rdquo; to run experiments on them. These were completely innocent people. Probable cause? Due process? I hardly know her&hellip;</p>
<p>The caveat in the amendment about times of war is doubly-interesting: despite the fact that Congress holds the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/War-Powers/">exclusive right</a> to declare war, it <strong>hasn&rsquo;t done so <a href="https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/WarDeclarationsbyCongress.htm">since 1942</a></strong>. Last I checked, though, we&rsquo;ve been at war 90% of the time since then (Vietnam, Korea, Middle East, etc.)&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="amendment-vi">Amendment VI</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if this amendment was upheld? Apparently we defined &ldquo;speedy&rdquo; <a href="https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2517&amp;context=lawreview">in 1974</a> as being&hellip; over three months? Nice. That aside, we still have people stuck in jail for <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/06/12/the-man-who-spent-35-years-in-prison-without-a-trial">35 years</a> without a trial and thousands of others waiting <a href="https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2016/11/16/incarcerated-years-without-trial/">more than two years</a>. In fact, something like 20% of prisoners are awaiting trials and <em>possible</em> convinctions. That&rsquo;s just&hellip; absurd. Of course, it becomes apparent why this is the case when you consider that <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/private-prisons-united-states/">many</a> prisons are privately-owned, and that the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Thirteenth-Amendment">13th Amendment</a> literally lets prisoners be treated like slaves, but that&rsquo;s a whole separate can of worms. We even have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay#U.S._control_of_Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay">entire area</a> off-shore dedicated to imprisoning people (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_detainees_at_Guantanamo_Bay">U.S. citizens</a>) without a trial.</p>
<!-- 
## Amendment VII
> In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

As far as I can tell, if someone *gets* a trial (rather than [dies waiting](https://www.google.com/search?q=man%20dies%20waiting%20for%20trial) for one), they always get the option of a trial by jury, and double jeapardy is [enforced](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-oj-simpson-knife-double-jeopardy-20160304-story.html) as well.
 -->
<h2 id="amendment-viii">Amendment VIII</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subjectivity of this amendment is, of course, laughable, and it leads directly to obvious violations.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess if you ignore waterboarding&mdash;ahem, sorry, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_interrogation_techniques">enhanced interrogation techniques</a>&rdquo;; prison sentences for drug possession (up to <a href="https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/drug-possession-penalties-and-sentencing.html">10 years</a>) relative to, say, sexual assault of an unconscious student (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner">6 months</a>); or thousand-dollar <a href="https://www.carinsurance.com/driving-without-insurance-penalties-state.aspx">fines</a> for driving without insurance (because fining someone who can&rsquo;t afford insurance makes sense) then sure, the government has never inflicted cruel and unusual punishment upon people or fined them excessively.</p>
<!-- 
## Amendment IX & X
We've finally come to the final, "catch-all" amendments:

> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

and 

> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

I've seen too many instances of the federal government coercing states into behaving a certain way: deciding the minimum drinking age is a state right, but the federal government will [cut your funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act) if you don't follow its guidelines; the same principle [applies](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/827112633224544256?lang=en) to public university curriculum; 

I'm not sure where we went wrong, but in my mind, this could not be more clear: **if it's not in the Constitution, the States get to decide**. And yet, we see exactly the opposite thing happen all the time. Maybe that's the way it should be, and that's a separate discussion, but fundamentally we can essentially disregard the Tenth Amendment in modern times.

<!-- # On Wealth Distribution
The content and docile middle class will never stand up against injustice towards their own countrymen for the simple fact that it rarely affects them. It's truly the epitome of proletariat exploitation: the so-called "middle" class (who is actually still just the working class with a few more earthly comforts) looks disparagingly at the "lower" class (in other words, at their fellow workers) and vice-versa, while the truly wealthy, capital-owning bourgeoisie continue to reap the fruits of the former's labor under the guise of "providing jobs."

When presented with the notion of "trickle-down economics," people often interpret it to mean that cutting slack for corporations (via tax cuts, deregulation, etc.) will lead to raises for workers and investments in job expansion. Of course, we know it just leads to [share buybacks](https://apnews.com/438fae12f9204b1fbd8e8b1985ae554f). There's some truth in the phrase, though. What it means is this: just enough of the river of wealth trickles down to the middle class to fuel the illusion that they can acquire more. This "trickle" takes many forms: investment dividends (which)

In simpler terms, the **massive**, unbelievable amount of wealth in the United States enables the powers that be to throw us *just* enough to keep us fighting amongst ourselves and not realizing how badly we're getting fleeced. Don't fool yourself: financial independence, true multi-generational wealth, or any form of government influence is purely, entirely unattainable for 99.9% of us; yes, that includes you, dear reader. 1/2 of us collectively own a paltry 1.2% of the total wealth in this country, while the top 1/10th owns 70% of it. And they don't share; in fact, they'd probably spend all of it just to ensure nobody else got any.

<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion&hellip;</h1>
<p>The United States has truly evolved into a perfect system for a select, privileged few. The revolving door between corporations, international banks, and the federal government means the same groups are pulling the strings. The beautiful promises of democracy and first-world comforts keep us happy and our good nature makes us wish those luxuries for others. We&rsquo;ve bought into the lie that everyone can live like we do as those same promises are used to stage coups, destroy ecosystems, and funnel wealth back to the same groups at the top.</p>

<p>And if we try to change any of that, and I mean <em>really</em> change it, we&rsquo;re met with physical, economic, and legal resistance on all fronts. Our &ldquo;rights&rdquo; seem to wither away at the most opportune moments. I think there are only two ways to move forward if you acknowledge this truth:</p>

  This post has been a long time coming, but I wish I&rsquo;d prepared for it better. For years I&rsquo;ve mentally documented the injustices of the world, but I should&rsquo;ve been noting them literally so I could source them here. There are so many examples, but, inevitably, the relentless stream of new tragedies lends itself to recency bias and difficulty in digging up history.
