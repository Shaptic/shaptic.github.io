        <p>Why do we blindly accept the notion that value is subjective? While it may be an axiom of economics that two people can be willing to pay vastly different amounts of money for the same commodity, does the inverse necessarily follow? Namely, is it economically necessary to exploit this willingness and actually charge vastly different amounts for largely-identical products?</p>
<p>In this short essay, I&rsquo;ll throw this assumption out the window and try to develop an approach to subjective value that is founded less in exploitation of human variability and more in sound moral principles.</p>

<h1 id="economic-terminology">Economic Terminology</h1>
<p>Under any economic theory, commodities have four key attributes, all of which might <em>feel</em> self-referential and redundant, but are actually very distinct in the way they describe the worth of a commodity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)"><strong>value</strong></a> describes the <em>economic</em> value of a commodity, or the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; it provides its owner. Note that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily reflective of price, though they&rsquo;re often correlated. Consider, for example, drinking water, whose value is essentially infinite to humans in that it staves off dehydration and death, and yet is monetarily valued on the order of pennies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value"><strong>exchange value</strong></a> defines the proportion at which one commodity can be exchanged for another. This is typically expressed in relation to another commodity. For example, one might define the exchange value of the latest iPhone to be 100 large pizzas, or, more-realistically, a bite of your burger for a long sip of my milkshake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value"><strong>use value</strong></a> (or <strong>utility</strong>) describes the &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; of a commodity. For example, diamonds are expensive, but we&rsquo;d be hard-pressed in describing their utility. Sure, they are used in high-end drilling equipment, but beyond that, their value definitely does not derive from their usefulness. Compare that to an electric mixer, for example, whose price is clearly much lower yet utility is much higher; after all, it could single-handedly power a bakery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the final attribute, <strong>price</strong>, is relatively self-explanatory: this is the dollar value we prescribe to a particular commodity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though these attributes might not have immediate, direct bearing in this entry, they&rsquo;re absolutely worth considering and distinguishing in any economic discussion about value and worth.</p>
<h1 id="labor-value">Labor Value</h1>
<p>In classical economics, the value of a commodity was considered to be a reflection of the human labor that went into producing it. Under Marx' <a href="source">labor theory of value</a> (henceforth referred to as the LTV), the capitalist system exploits laborers by virtue of the fact that commodities are valued at much, <em>much</em> more than the labor value put into creating them.</p>
<p>To many (and especially to those in the working class itself), this perception &ldquo;feels&rdquo; correct: either (a) the <em>price</em> of a pair of &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; sunglasses should reflect the cumulative value of the labor &amp; materials put in by the designer, manufacturer, transporter, cashier, etc. (meaning no sunglasses should ever be priced at more than, say, $20), or (b) the <em>compensation</em> of the aforementioned workers should be reflective of the profits made from a single pair (meaning nobody in the supply chain should be making less that $20/pair).</p>
<p>And yet, we continue to see \$5 of plastic processed by a few dollars worth of labor sell for hundreds of dollars of profit for a select few. We see restaurant owners pocketing profits while chefs get paid under the table to prepare the very meals that keep people coming back; we see banks generate billions of dollars without a sliver going back to laborers who worked the very grounds they stand on; and we even see doctors literally saving lives while insurance companies charge patients $50 for an aspirin.</p>
<p>Any way you cut it, the system appears to be built on exploitation. <strong>What reconciles the gap between price and labor value?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-paradox-of-value">The Paradox of Value</h2>
<p>Would you exchange a set of nice headphones for a handful of pizzas? Probably not, despite them technically being purchasable for the same amount of money. You might say no for a number of reasons: the trade wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;even&rdquo; (exchange value), you need the headphones more (utility), or maybe you simply hate pizza. What if you were absolutely starving, though? At that vulnerable moment, you might even exchange them for a <em>single</em> pizza. Or perhaps the pizza has anchovies on it, which you&rsquo;re obsessed with but haven&rsquo;t tasted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxnlx7JoAP4">thousand years</a>.</p>
<p>This odd phenomenon is present in many exchanges: trading a memory foam mattress for the latest iPhone, a fancy sports car for a single family home, or even a few cups of coffee for a Netflix subscription all seem like extremely odd and disbalanced exchanges, despite each of these scenarios trading (approximately) equivalent dollar amounts.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this approach to value is no longer used (as we&rsquo;re about to see below), it&rsquo;s still incredibly important to remember that all purchases are a literal exchange of some portion of the finite time, effort, and toil we as humans are capable of for a material good.</p>
<h1 id="subjective-value">Subjective Value</h1>
<p>Clearly, then, the value of a particular commodity (or trade) is incredibly <strong>subjective</strong>. This is essentially the frame of mind powering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value">subjective theory of value</a> (STV) which molds our current understanding of microeconomics in the Western world. Even though the LTV seems like a fairer evaluation of human labor, the STV does a better job of representing reality.</p>
<p>With the world viewed through a subjective lens, the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo; suddenly appears justifiable: a single worker can produce many similar pairs of sunglasses, and the distributor can charge arbitrarily depending on the subjective value consumers are willing to pay for each distinct pair.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>More concretely, consider a single pair of luxury sunglasses priced at \$400 retail. If you asked someone what they&rsquo;re worth after the plastic frame is molded, they&rsquo;re unlikely to bid very high. Similarly, when the lenses are added, the price isn&rsquo;t likely to change much. Not even when the shades are packaged and put on the shelf will they be valued anywhere near \$400 by the average person. Yet as <strong><em>soon</em></strong> as you etch the brand name into the corner of the lens, the crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>Is it the etching technology, the paint, or the font that causes this jump? Nope; it&rsquo;s a bizarre, ethereal association with something greater than the single pair of sunglasses can represent on its own that is suddently worth $350+. The sunglasses are worth <strong>exactly how much someone is willing to pay for them</strong>, irrespective of their labor, exchange, or even use values.</p>
<p>This phenomenon embodies subjective value.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This interpretation of value quickly leads us down a rather dark path. We&rsquo;ve already touched on some examples, in which someone trades 5 hours of human life at a minimum wage job in exchange for a few bucks worth of sun-dimming plastic,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but there&rsquo;s more to it than that. The STV naturally breeds practices that are inherently immoral.</p>
<h3 id="infinite-growth">Infinite Growth</h3>
<p>The STV fundamentally enables a desire for infinite economic growth: <strong>subjective value can always be increased</strong>. This means <em>moar</em> products, <em>higher</em> profits, and growth <em>at all costs</em>. The latter point is a death sentence to  the finite, fragile ecosystem we live in.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In the greed-fueled chase for ever-increasing subjective value, there are no qualms. The trade unionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dunning">Thomas Dunning</a> observed this phenomenon quite early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 percent will ensure its employment anywhere; 20 percent certain will produce eagerness; 50 percent, positive audacity; 100 percent will make it ready to trample on all human laws; 300 percent, and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This consequence goes hand-in-hand with marketing, our upcoming implication: the simplest way to promote growth is not by producing more value or offering innovation, it is by convincing your customers that your commodities are worth more.</p>
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>
<p>As we just mentioned, subjective value opens the door to marketing. &ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; is an innocent-sounding word; let&rsquo;s call it what it is: psychologically manipulating you into perceiving something as being worth far more than it really is. This process typically involves pretty unethical behavior and abuse of fundamental human weaknesses. Marketing is essentially built on top of psychology, consistently taking advantage of (and sometimes pushing the boundaries of, since there are little-to-no <a href="https://www.apa.org/about/governance/bdcmte/ethics-committee">ethical standards</a> in place) the latest research into human behavior.</p>
<p>The examples are endless and varied in complexity: the layout of grocery stores is <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2015/06/15/surviving-the-sneaky-psychology-of-supermarkets/">designed to maximize puchases</a>; the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741065/">middle shelf</a> is manipulated to sell high-margin goods; the elementary <a href="https://www.dailyinfographic.com/the-psychology-of-colors-infographic">use of color</a> to can provoke feelings of hunger; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity">artificial scarcity</a> drives up prices; we even perceive expensive things as being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sc/why-we-like-expensive-things-2018-12">higher quality</a>; the list goes on and on&hellip; All of these tactics have a single goal in mind: to subtly manipulate your mind to promote more-frequent and more-expensive purchases. When did we &ldquo;okay&rdquo; this behavior? Apparently, we never even noticed it. It&rsquo;s been a slow boil, and now we treat &ldquo;product propoganda&rdquo; as the norm.</p>
<p>We should return to (or perhaps found?) an environment of conscientious, ethical marketing whose goal is the betterment of its consumers rather than their exploitation. Each of these psychological tactics <em>could</em> be used for good: why not place the healthiest items on the middle shelf, use color to promote satiation, and organize stores for shopper optimality?</p>
<p>I hope the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AebWc48zOxg">unfortunate answer</a> is obvious enough.</p>
<h1 id="conscientious-theory-of-value">Conscientious Theory of Value</h1>
<p>As an ethically-grounded alternative to these model, I&rsquo;d like to propose a new theory of value whose goal is to merge the efficiency of the STV with the concrete nature of the LTV. I call it the <strong>conscientious theory of value</strong>.</p>
<p>The key thesis of the CTV is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being willing to overpay absurd amounts of money for a commodity as a consumer, there is quite a bit wrong with <strong>charging</strong> that amount of money as a merchant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No ethical, good-faith merchant should overcharge for their goods beyond the value they personally contributed.</p>
<p>To define it more as a parallel to the other theories of value, we can say that the</p>
<h2 id="defining-overcharging">Defining &ldquo;Overcharging&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Reading the above, some of you may think about&mdash;or be reminded about the harsh realities of&mdash;<strong>planned economies</strong>, in which governments dictate the prices and production quantities of various goods in advance.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> That isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s being proposed here; rather,</p>

<p>Obviously, the type of person who buys expensive sunglasses is unlikely to be the type of person to have a minimum wage job, but the point still stands: <em>someone</em>&mdash;a real human being with unique life experiences, desires, and loved ones to care for&mdash;would need to trade 5 hours of their life for some new shades. And, of course, we&rsquo;re completely ignoring the fact that the very idea of a minimum wage is exclusive to wealthy first-world countries.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
