        <h1 id="a-recent-revelation">a recent revelation</h1>
<p>Someone recently told me something about myself. It&rsquo;s a rare and cherishable thing to experience: someone&rsquo;s subjective opinion of you from their perspective. We&rsquo;re often so caught up in our own thoughts and self-image that we can completely misconstrue reality and how we present ourselves to the world. They said (albeit not word-for-word because the precise phrasing has already abandoned my memory):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are logical and calculated, yet prefer not to exceed the bounds of your comfort zone. In a word, you are very hesitant to take risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m flattered that my tendency to carefully consider the world around me and act in a rational, calculated manner is so apparent; however, it&rsquo;s interesting to see such a sharp, precise observation happen so quickly.</p>
<h2 id="risk--reward">risk &amp; reward</h2>
<p>Let me enumerate and consider the various significant risks I&rsquo;ve taken in my life and analyse their outcomes. I feel that life has taught me through non-trivial punishments to be risk-averse:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Risk</th>
<th>Outcome</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Investments:</strong> Gambles on a number of risky stocks turned out less than ideal.</td>
<td>Did I make 18% over ~3 years? Yeah, but that&rsquo;s a pretty pathetic return (~6%/yr) considering the state of the US economy during that time period. Just investing safely in \$SPY would&rsquo;ve netted me 37%&hellip; The risks I took on \$NVDA, on \$TSLA, on \$ATVI, etc. all kept me holding bags for months before getting my returns in the black again. And let&rsquo;s not even talk about cryptocurrency: I&rsquo;m still holding some coins from peak Ethereum&hellip;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Relationship</strong>: Well, I moved across the entire country for a girl.</td>
<td>It cost me thousands of dollars both purely monetarily and in my material possessions; hundreds of hours on the road; and months of emotional turmoil and eventual heartbreak. However, you can&rsquo;t put a price on the realisation that a relationship has no future. You could definitely make the argument that the move itself was me staying in the &ldquo;comfort zone&rdquo; of my relationship and that the unrealized &ldquo;risk&rdquo; was moving on sooner&hellip;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Career</strong>: Well I moved two states away from everything I&rsquo;ve ever known to explore a place I&rsquo;d dreamed about for years.</td>
<td>Burnout, loneliness, and the existential creep that comes with being a pointless cog in a massive, redundant machine chewed up a bright-eyed graduate and spit out a cynic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Haircuts</strong>: This is a really odd one to throw in, but yeah, haircuts.</td>
<td>I think I&rsquo;ve had only one haircut I&rsquo;ve been satisfied with in the past decade? Half of the reason why I settled with the manbun-and-beard look I sport today is because (a) it requires little upkeep and (b) it acts like a security blanket for my face.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m generally risk averse. Is that because</p>
<h2 id="effects-of-upbringing">effects of upbringing</h2>
<h2 id="yet">&ldquo;yet&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting choice of words. The implication is subtle, but present: a tendency not to take risk is perceived as a <em>bad</em> thing. Now, an inability to leave your comfort zone may be bad in many situations—leading to social anxieties, self-stagnation, etc.—but it does not really correlate well to the idea of risk.</p>
<h1 id="intellectual-risk">intellectual risk</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the rationale with which I&rsquo;ve deftly defended my fragile ego may begin to fall apart. Consider a world in which our worldly decisions are relatively meaningless and possibly even uncontrolled. Consider, then, risks that are devoid of any of these superficial, worldly layers. Consider the risks that can only exists within the mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think, therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is it that I think? And is there some truth in the notion that I don&rsquo;t take <em>intellectual</em> risks to broaden my horizons beyond the philosophical frames that comfort me?</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">philosophy</h2>
<p>My exploration of life&rsquo;s fleeting purpose has led me to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox variant, of course)</li>
<li>Buddhism (primarily through meditation and <em>Mindfulness in Plain English</em>)</li>
<li>existentialism (primarly through Camus, though this is merely the fallback philosophy for when all else fails)</li>
<li>stoicism (the most recent development, through Aurelius' <em>Meditations</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, this feels like a relatively diverse list of philosophies. However, it&rsquo;s absolutely true that I haven&rsquo;t given them the time of day they deserve; I scratch their surface, grab some pithy clichés that fit my existing world-view, and move on to the next sample at the table. The taste of moral and philosophical superiority that the smattering of ideas that each provided is an addicting poison that only stunts growth rather than promote it.</p>
<h1 id="essence">essence</h1>
<p>yeah, I should take more risks</p>
