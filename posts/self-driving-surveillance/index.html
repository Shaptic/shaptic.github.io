<p>The year is 2050. China has <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-wants-to-be-first-to-colonize-the-moon-and-mars">colonized Mars</a>, income inequality is at an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/screen-shot-2020-01-08-at-5-06-47-pm/">all-time high</a>, and Elon Musk has finally delivered on <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html">Level 5 automation</a> in his Tesla fleet. The future is now. But what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s next: <strong>a global surveillance network powered by autonomous vehicles equipped with dozens of cameras and microphones.</strong> Step aside, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a>, there&rsquo;s a better way to watch people now. 👀</p>
<h2 id="first-a-short-history-lesson">First, a short history lesson</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again, technological innovation designed to push the boundaries of human potential and make our lives easier<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> gets subverted for nefarious, dystopian purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The credit card, designed to simplify personal finance, <a href="https://www.consumerismcommentary.com/10-purchases-that-can-harm-your-credit/">turned into</a> a behavior-analysis method that encourages class boundaries: Buying alcohol consistently? You&rsquo;re probably less likely to pay back a loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The telephone, one of the first ways for people to privately communicate across distances, <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/how-it-works">hasn&rsquo;t been safe</a> from curious, state-sponsored ears in a long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications like Facebook, whose <a href="https://investor.fb.com/resources/default.aspx">mission</a> is allegedly to &ldquo;give people the power to build communities,&rdquo; and Google, whose <a href="https://about.google/">mission</a> is to &ldquo;organize the world&rsquo;s information,&rdquo; are abstracted data-harvesting platforms that use <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">everything they learn</a> about you to reliably sell you things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The smartphone in general, a handheld device granting the world instant access to infinite knowledge and opportunity, is mostly just a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/the-u-s-government-is-secretly-using-cell-phone-location-data-to-track-us-were-suing/">location-</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@Appseecom/best-tools-for-tracking-user-behavior-on-mobile-apps-b980cfa2165d">behavior-</a>tracking platform. Ads aside, it&rsquo;s also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-uses-instagram-etsy-linkedin-to-find-george-floyd-protester-2020-6">used by the government</a> to suppress dissent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the <strong>machine gun</strong> was invented with the reduction of human suffering in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">If I could invent a gun which could, by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred, it would supersede the necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle would be greatly diminished.</p>
  
    <p class="quote-attribution">
      &mdash; Richard Jordan Gatling, <em>on the invention of the machine gun</em>
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>And we all know how that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties">turned out</a>.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> why <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> the self-driving car be well on its way to turning into a global surveillance and snitching network?</p>
<h2 id="now-the-future-ahead">Now, the future ahead</h2>
<p>The police already equip <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number-plate_recognition">ALPRs</a>&mdash;automatic license plate recognizers&mdash;on their squad cards (71% of departments do, at least); your autonomous vehicle will have one built in. Teslas already have a way for your parked car to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla">look around</a>, and having it scan nearby faces and license plates isn&rsquo;t science fiction, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-surveillance-detection-scout/">reality</a>. If random hackers can already do it, so can the government; they don&rsquo;t even <em>need</em> compliance from corporations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before this becomes a feature rather than a <del>bug</del> security hole, and a slightly-longer matter of time before this becomes an entire network rather than something your car does just for you.</p>
<p>Ever rolled a stop sign when nobody is around? Your car will report that. Ever sped on an empty highway? Not anymore, unless you want to get snitched on.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> We already have <a href="https://www.wexinc.com/insights/blog/fleet/how-gps-vehicle-tracking-can-lower-your-insurance-premiums/">precedent</a> with insurance carriers offering discounts for putting their GPS tracker into your car; why not get the car itself involved? And let&rsquo;s make other cars keep an eye on you, too, <em>just for good measure</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get even more nefarious: why stop at car behavior? With object &amp; facial recognition performing better than ever, dozens of high-quality cameras available&mdash;including 3D ones that sense depth&mdash;on a <em>single car</em>, and an always-on satellite Internet connection, the world is our oyster. Log, upload, and analyze everything! After all, when was the last time you did something <em>without</em> a car nearby?</p>
<p>Strolled by a shoe store? Ad ready in your next app.</p>
<p>On your way to work? Here&rsquo;s a coffee shop recommendation.</p>
<p>Jaywalked? Reported.</p>
<p>Shoplifted? Straight to jail<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiyfwZVAzGw">.</a></p>
<p>Attended a protest? Noted.</p>
<p>Out past curfew? <em>Knock knock.</em></p>
<p><strong>Existed?</strong> Location, time-of-day, outfit, and nearby company recorded.</p>
<p>I threw in shoplifting there on purpose: why <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> we want to prevent crime? And yep, that&rsquo;s exactly how they&rsquo;ll sell it to us. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear&hellip; right?</p>
<p>Get ready for a world in which the ever-watchful <del>eyes</del> cameras on autonomous vehicles become a global police force. But at least we&rsquo;ll be able to get drunk at the bar and make it home without calling a cab, right?</p>
<p><em>Progress.</em></p>
