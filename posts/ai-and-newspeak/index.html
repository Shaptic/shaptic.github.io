        <p>&lt;rant&gt;</p>
<p>The resurgence of AI (well, more specifically, of machine and deep learning) in the last decade has brought about some significant innovations, whether it be in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03298-6">beating humans at Starcraft</a>, creating potential for <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-translatotron-universal-translation,news-30104.html">universal translators</a>, or even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48995-4">detecting cancer</a>.</p>
<p>However, it has also caused significant cultural and social harm. There&rsquo;s the obvious problems caused by the privacy-invasive and fundamentally <em>creepy</em> analysis that machine learning enables, tracking activity and manipulating behavior en masse based on data points generated from online activity, but that&rsquo;s not what this post is about.</p>
<p>A more pertinent vein of concern is the simple fact that these black box algorithms shape our lives and our culture, ultimately converging on a <strong>monoculture</strong> in the chase for optimality. Even in the world of <em>natural language</em>, AI (or, rather, those who weaponize it for profit) has overstepped its bounds.</p>
<h2 id="on-ai-driven-monoculture">On AI-Driven Monoculture</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve alluded <a href="../p2p/#centralization-vs-democratization">before</a> to the dangers of letting algorithms cater our lives. Like the fantastic documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224"><em>The Social Dilemma</em></a> purports, companies have goals in mind, and their algorithms do whatever is necessary to achieve that goal. That&rsquo;s simply how <a href="/assets/ml-notes.pdf">machine learning</a> works:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">Algorithms are optimised to some definition of success. So if you can imagine, if a commercial enterprise builds an algorithm, to their definition of success, it’s a commercial interest. It’s usually profit.</p>
  
    <p style="font-size: smaller; font-style: normal; margin-left: 3rem">
      &mdash; Cathy O’Neil, <em>The Social Dilemma</em>
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>We see the affect of these &ldquo;success&rdquo;-oriented, black-box algorithms in a number of cultural domains.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/05/10-years-of-spotify-should-we-celebrate-or-despair#maincontent">encourages</a> a musical monoculture by incentivizing songs that game algorithms and help artists get their music onto auto-generated playlists:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">Playlists have fundamentally changed the listening experience. [They] limit music discovery and the sound of music itself. Singles are tailored to beat the skip-rate that hinders a song&rsquo;s chances of making it on to a popular playlist: hooks and choruses hit more quickly. Homogenous mid-tempo pop drawing from rap and EDM has become dominant. The algorithm pushes musicians to create monotonous music in vast quantities for peak chart success. <strong>Music appears in danger of becoming a kind of grey goo.</strong></p>
  
    <p style="font-size: smaller; font-style: normal; margin-left: 3rem">
      &mdash; Laura Snapes, &ldquo;Has 10 years of Spotify ruined music?&rdquo;
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;How was radio any different?&rdquo; you might ask. The big difference is the same as it is for all pre-Internet similarities: <strong>scale</strong>. The sheer scale, breadth, proliferance, and dynamic (relative to radio) nature of playlists on Spotify (or YouTube, or Apple Music, or what-have-you) make them far more widespread and influential on pushing a musical monoculture than radio ever did. Even if you like to stay off the beaten path of pop music, it&rsquo;s undeniable that many of us give up the uniqueness (and with it, effort) of a personal music library in lieu of a playlist curated for the genres we enjoy, artists we follow, or even moods we experience.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>Fascinatingly, rather than herding humanity (well, I&rsquo;ll speak for America specifically) into ideological <strong>mono</strong>culture, we instead have increasing polarization into <em>two</em> extremes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem"><p>From the point of view of watch time, this <strong>polarization is extremely efficient at keeping people online</strong>.</p>
<p>People think the algorithm is designed to give them what they really want, only it’s not. The algorithm is actually trying to find a few rabbit holes that are very powerful, trying to find which rabbit hole is the closest to your interest.</p>
</p>
  
    <p style="font-size: smaller; font-style: normal; margin-left: 3rem">
      &mdash; Guillaume Chaslot, <em>The Social Dilemma</em>
    </p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, a political monoculture would bring about unity, given that by definition most people would be on the same page, but unity does not breed engagement.</p>
<p>Just like before, we see AI manipulating our behavior in order to encourage its goals, and the result of that manipulation is a simplification of our political perspectives, a destruction of individuality, and a transition towards mindless groupthink.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-language">And Now: Language</h2>
<p>I was writing an email (as one does), and Outlook decided to try to be helpful in simplifying my language:</p>

<p>Clearer for my reader? First of all, you don&rsquo;t even <em>know</em> my reader. You also obviously don&rsquo;t understand context or nuance, Cortana. There&rsquo;s a massive difference between &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be more interested&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;d <em>definitely</em> be more interested&rdquo; when it comes to incentives: the latter relays a level of enthusiasm the other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Sure, if the goal is to homogenize the English language into something akin to a programming language, with a &ldquo;standard library&rdquo; of helper <del>functions</del> phrases that everyone universally uses to convey over-simplified concepts, then</p>

<p><em>Newspeak</em>, for readers unfamiliar with the term, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a controlled language of simplified grammar and restricted vocabulary designed to limit the individual&rsquo;s ability to think and articulate &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; concepts such as personal identity, self-expression and free will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept comes from Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, and in that novel the concept is used to maintain authoritarian control over the populace by literally limiting language to prevent critical thinking (or other &ldquo;radical&rdquo; ideas).</p>
<p>Now, this seems like a bit of an extreme comparison to what essentially amounts to a resurgence of <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/884/455/9ad.jpg">Microsoft Clippy</a>, but if Bing can <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57367100">censor search queries</a> about China&rsquo;s Tiananmen Square demonstrations and Amazon can use <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/">doorbells to help the police</a> force, it&rsquo;s not <em>really</em> a stretch to presume that Microsoft (or Grammarly, or Google) could use their unique positions in the &ldquo;humans writing things&rdquo; niche to slowly, carefully alter common phrases or vocabulary in the English language to promote an agenda.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Dystopias aside, even if there&rsquo;s no alterior, malevolent motive, there&rsquo;s still harm being done. These suggestions fundamentally alter how we regularly use language by simplifying it, which limits how well we can articulate our thoughts. Language is <em>already</em> a very &ldquo;low bandwidth&rdquo; way to express ourselves: think about how precisely and carefully you need to choose your words and phrasing to convey specific, complex thoughts. There&rsquo;s always room for misinterpretation by your reader. In other words, it&rsquo;s <em>already</em> hard to express ourselves in simple terms, and these auto-generated &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; suggestions make that problem worse, not better.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Back in the day, marketers and advertisers worked hard alongside scientists to find &ldquo;exploits&rdquo; in human psychology that they could use to manipulate us into buying things or behaving in certain ways. From that, we got things like <strong>color-coordinated advertising</strong> (where <a href="https://awgsalesservices.com/2016/04/21/color-psychology-in-food-marketing/">red &amp; yellow evoke hunger</a>), the <strong>center-stage effect</strong> (where people prefer things <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057740809000291">located the middle</a>), <strong>price anchoring</strong> principles (where overly-expensive items <a href="https://www.finehomebuilding.com/2016/12/26/psychology-price-anchoring">make others look affordable</a>), and the field of <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-consumer-psychology-2794899">consumer psychology</a> in general.</p>
<p>Now, the algorithms do it for us: we&rsquo;ve built massive systems essentially designed to learn how to exploit human weaknesses. We&rsquo;re actively engineering our own cultural, social, and psychological destruction in the name of <del>engagement</del> profit.</p>
