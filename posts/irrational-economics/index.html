        <p></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some deep irony to the fact that a lot of economic theory operates under the idea that humans operate rationally: this statement is in-and-of-itself irrational.</p>
<p>We should be spreading the &ldquo;proven&rdquo; economic insights across the distribution of people that act rationally when faced with economic decisions. Here&rsquo;s a series of questions that prove how non-sensical of an assumption this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What percentage of people read both the <em>price</em> and the <em>weight</em> of items they buy at the grocery store?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of people can do (or at least approximate) division with 2-4 digit numbers, e.g. 4.20/16 = ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of those people can also quickly (or approximately) convert between units, e.g. between grams and ounces?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of those people can recognize that applying the above math gives an item&rsquo;s cost per unit of weight?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of those people recognize that this is the way to fairly compare the price of two products?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of those people <em>actually do all of the above</em>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that each subsequent question reduces the pool more and more. Yet this is the <strong>bare minimum</strong> to being a &ldquo;rational economic actor&rdquo;. On top of that, we have to evaluate subjective differences between products that can be compared in this way, e.g. brand, quality, nutritional value, BAC%, expiration date, your cravings or emotional state that day, etc.</p>
<p>This tall, ever-growing list of requirements makes it impossible to truly be a rational economic actor. Furthermore, the subjective nature of the latter items is ripe for exploitation and manipulation by anyone who wants to sway the opinion of a consumer in a particular direction: advertisers, health gurus, brand ambassadors, self-help guides, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop at the grocery store either, as you can imagine. It applies when you&rsquo;re buying headphones on Amazon, fruit at a farmers&rsquo; market, a meal at a restaurant. Tons of money can be made when you have an information advantage over your consumer: the harder it is for us to answer the question of &ldquo;Is this the best bang for my buck?&rdquo; the more money can be squeezed out of us.</p>
<p>We can &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; the information gathering to others, but this is both a fuzzy and incomplete approach. Fundamentally, to be a rational economic actor, you have to be privy to <em>all</em> of the information available about the thing you&rsquo;re purchasing, which is a task rivaling Sisyphus&rsquo; rock.</p>
<p>This same is noted by the &ldquo;Efficient Market Hypothesis&rdquo; in the world of finance: it claims that market prices adjust rapidly in response to new public information. And yet, while processed meat is definitively proven to cause cancer, bacon is still as expensive as ever. A rational economic actor would have no interest in cancer&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-irrationomics">Examples of Irrationomics</h2>
<p>Here are some more fun economic decisions that make absolutely no sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonchalantly spending \$50 on a meal, yet meticulously deciding between two shirts that cost \$8 or \$10.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former is one of three meals you have to eat pretty much every day of your life, while the other is a clothing item you&rsquo;ll wear dozens and dozens of times over the next year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying exorbitant prices for food delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that delivery apps add fees, don&rsquo;t include tips, and even charge higher prices for the same menu items vs. the restaurant you&rsquo;re ordering from, the price almost always doubles and can sometimes even triple. I&rsquo;ve seen a \$9 burrito somehow end up costing \$25. I&rsquo;m willing to bet many people aren&rsquo;t making that much per hour at their <em>actual job</em> (which puts a dollar value on their time <em>by definition</em>), yet spend it haphazardly on a cold burrito and stale tortilla chips that get there 45 minutes after your impulsivity has worn off and leave you shamefully full.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fun one that applies in the reverse direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving extra distances to save money on gas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we drove an extra 3mi to save \$0.05/gal. If we take into account vehicle wear-and-tear (which the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates">approximates</a> at \$0.585/mi), the amount of time that extra 3mi takes (which we&rsquo;ll call a 10-minute round trip through city traffic), and the cost of your time (which we&rsquo;ll call minimum wage for the sake of argument), that comes out to:</p>
<pre><code>(6mi * $0.585/mi) + 10min * ($7.25/60min) = $4.72
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, it cost you <strong>$4.72</strong> to save $0.60 on gas (assuming a 12-gallon tank). Hell, let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of argument that your time is worthless and you use the IRS charity rate: that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> $0.84 of wear-and-tear on your car.</p>
<p>Not worth it, yet I&rsquo;m guilty of it all the time&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="anyway">Anyway&hellip;</h2>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ve convinced you that more often than not, we&rsquo;re not going to make the best economic choices. There&rsquo;s not much we can do about it besides try to inform ourselves, but not only is there information overload, it&rsquo;s also constantly changing (thank you, science!).</p>
<p>And since sellers typically have information gain over buyers (especially at scale, since there&rsquo;s one seller to many buyers), we&rsquo;re probably just screwed.</p>
