    <article role="article">
        <p>How? How can God allow this to happen? Yet it&rsquo;s not fair to blame God. Humans
are the ones that allow this to happen. As they said in the final prayer, we as
humans have to choose to serve God and do His will through our own hands. We
can&rsquo;t expect Him to magically whip up a solution and solve the homeless
crisis&hellip; (which isn&rsquo;t to say that He couldn&rsquo;t, but we cannot blame him for
respecting our free will and not interfering in our lives directly&hellip; we are
reaping what we&rsquo;ve sown). At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s up to us.</p>
<p>Then the question transforms: How can WE allow this to happen? The richest
country in the world, yet an entire underground society, with its own rules,
hierarchies, and customs, sprouts in (probably) every city and somehow
flourishes (if you can call it that).</p>
<p><em>What have we done?</em></p>
<p>Gratitude. I&rsquo;ve never seen such joy for such (what we consider to be) trifles.
The less we have, the more we&rsquo;re thankful for. The more we have, the less
meaningful a gift is, especially if we can afford that gift for ourselves. If
you don&rsquo;t want for much, new things mean less. If you need, I mean truly need,
then to receive the gifts you need begets unparalleled gratitude. It&rsquo;s almost,
actually not even almost, it really is genuinely uncomfortable. I didn&rsquo;t
deserve any of the good thoughts that were sent my way. I was doing something
so simple, so elementary, so within my means that it was almost farcical to be
praised for it. Is doing good deeds in secret better? Does hearing &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;
actually make the experience worse, because you know you don&rsquo;t deserve the
thanks? Or is it the very fact that you feel that you don&rsquo;t deserve it the
entire point&hellip; You shouldn&rsquo;t get to run away from the feelings that this
morning came with.</p>
<p>Honestly, the average person I encountered on this special morning seemed more
content with their life than the average person I encounter in the day-to-day.
Despite their struggles and difficulties and needs, they wore their heart on
their sleeve and nothing was hidden. Their feelings and thoughts were all in
plain sight. Whether the hug for the boots, the earnest questions about what we
were offering (almost aggressively inquiring about food, or a second tarp, or a
bag, etc.), the fact that some completely ignored us, it was all right there in
the open. There were no games, no hiding or malicious intent (you can hardly
call taking everything that&rsquo;s offered you malicious behaviour or greed),
nothing beyond a pure soul-to-soul open line of communication that was only
inhibited by my own discomfort and unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>Maslow was right.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss, but I&rsquo;m glad I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgetting is as important as remembering,&rdquo; but this experience definitely
falls into the latter category.</p>
<p>My God, seeing those kids&hellip;</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t conceive or wrap my head around the fact that that goes on
<strong>every single day</strong> and I was that overwhelmed by a small, insignificant taste
of their life that I CHOSE to partake in. Many of them did not choose, or no
longer realize that they had (or have) a choice. I was a tourist in their life
and evaporated back into civilization as soon as I could escape it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with the experience.</p>
<p>Do I do it again?</p>
<p>Do I try to integrate what I felt in my day-to-day, and continue being
completely dissociated from what are now obviously trifles of the day-to-day?</p>
<p>Do I just try to be more open and compassionate towards the less-fortunate?
Should I start carrying a blanket, some gloves, and a bottle of water in my car
so that I can always help someone in need?</p>
<p>Honestly the scene near the Loaves &amp; Fishes felt like something straight out of
an apocalyptic novel. The crowd of disheveled people carrying their scraps
protectedly, the clear existence of a social structure yet the fact that its
internals were hidden from view, the families keeping their flock together and
suffering through the circumstances as a team, the complete lack of shame in
their conditions&hellip;</p>
<p>I have never felt such a foreign, indescribable potpourri of feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why is this happening?</li>
<li>Why are we the only ones out here?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not doing enough.</li>
<li>Is this real?</li>
<li>The good feelings were short-lived.</li>
<li>Utterly defeating and overwhelming sorrow.</li>
<li>Does it end?</li>
<li>Brief pockets of joy when someone accepted something&ndash;why? dig deeper</li>
<li>Discomfort from any appreciation.</li>
<li>Is our impact non-zero?</li>
<li>Awkwardness when ignored.</li>
<li>Fear.</li>
<li>Shock.</li>
<li><strong>Despair.</strong></li>
</ul>
