<p>With the President-Elect locked in for 2025, many expect things to change. In my view, President-Elect Trump essentially ran on a platform of &ldquo;Screw those guys; what did they ever do for you? Just elect me and I&rsquo;ll fix it,&rdquo; where &ldquo;it&rdquo; was left perfectly undefined so that all Americans could fill in with their own hopium.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sure to see what &ldquo;it&rdquo; really meant soon; many are hoping it means a turnaround in their grocery bill and in their general cost of living. Is that really something that&rsquo;s possible, regardless of administration? Simply put: <strong>absolutely not</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-vs-cumulative-inflation">Monthly vs. Cumulative Inflation</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that the average trip to the grocery store is much more expensive than it was before COVID decimated our society. We&rsquo;ve all seen the monthly (or annual) CPI numbers on the news and the interest rates on high-yield savings accounts fluctuate since the pandemic, peaking at almost 9% at one point in late 2022.</p>
<p>Whether you want to attribute this to supply chain setbacks, the Fed&rsquo;s <a href="https://brrr.money/">printer</a> injecting \$4T into the money supply, geopolitics, or simple corporate greed, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we have a <strong>cumulative</strong> inflation rate of <strong>around 22%</strong> since 2020.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> People are easily deceived since they only see monthly or yearly inflation statistics without thinking about how those percentages accumulate into a behemoth sucking away your net worth. Let&rsquo;s put that number into perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>A \$100 bill today would only buy you \$82 worth of goods in 2020.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That means that even though you&rsquo;re spending that \$100 at the grocery store today, you&rsquo;re only getting \$82 worth of actual &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; by 2020 metrics. Put another way, you would need \$122 today to buy the same set of groceries you paid \$100 for in 2020.</li>
<li>Extrapolating that, a \$100,000 annual salary in 2024 is the same thing as a \$82,000 salary was in 2020.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> That means unless you got raises totaling to 22% over the last 4 years, you&rsquo;re making less money than you did in 2020. Well, you&rsquo;re making more dollars, but the dollars don&rsquo;t go as far.</li>
<li>If you invested in an index fund—suppose one tracking the entire market like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VTI/">VTI</a>—in 2020, you would be up 55% on paper today,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> but inflation cuts into that gain almost in half to only (well, &ldquo;only&rdquo;) 23% over 4 years, which is a decent, but not strong, return&hellip; <em>Ahhhh who am I kidding</em>; that&rsquo;s still a crazy return. Moral of the story: don&rsquo;t let spare money sit around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suffice to say, the distance each of our dollar&rsquo;s can go has decreased significantly.</p>
<h1 id="inflation-trends">Inflation Trends</h1>
<p>Today, the misguided hope for the new administration as a force for curbing price increases relies on a fundamental misunderstanding about the way economics work: <strong>prices don&rsquo;t go down.</strong> Inflation is (essentially) <strong>always</strong> a positive percentage, meaning prices always increase. Negative inflation (or deflation), is not considered a good thing economically.</p>
<p>Look at the consumer price index (a.k.a. the fancy tracker for &ldquo;inflation,&rdquo; which can be manipulated as needed to not let the numbers look as bad as reality) for this millennia:</p>

</figure>

<p>The last time prices actually went down was in 2009, and there was a <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2009/03/risk-deflation/">significant concern</a> that deflation would spiral out of control. That means that prices have <strong>only gone up</strong> since 2010.</p>
<p>Now yes, CPI is technically the average of a bucket of categories. Each of these has their own price graph, but if you look at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">20 year plot</a> published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics themselves and plot everything besides energy-related categories, you can see that things still rarely dip into the negative. When they do, it&rsquo;s very short-lived, and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t decrease prices on a scale that&rsquo;s noticeable to a consumer over time. Here&rsquo;s the plot for food:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-gg">Conclusion? GG.</h1>
<p></p>
<p>One thing is systematically clear, which I think a lot of people are either oblivious or in denial about:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" align="center">
  Today's prices are here to stay.
</p>
<p>To use an borderline traumatic term: they&rsquo;re the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Forever gone are the days of 2/$1 candy bars, and if they ever come it&rsquo;ll be for the mini variant not the full size. If the current administration had a spine and curbed price increases in crucial categories to check corporate price-fixing at least a <em>little</em> bit so we didn&rsquo;t see that 10% spike in 2022, we could start from a better baseline. But, as Biden whispered, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr96lhRkbog">it grows the economy</a>&hellip; just&hellip; the part of the economy that doesn&rsquo;t affect real working class people.</p>
<p>The only way for us to resolve the issue is for <strong>wages to exceed the pace of inflation</strong>. Of course, I doubt we&rsquo;ll see anyone retroactively get 20% raises, nor any meaningful raises going forward if the trends of the past four years continue&hellip; Good luck everyone.</p>

# Tariffs and Inflation

There is some irony, of course, that tariffs are not a new concept being introduced by the Trump Administration next year. People are up in arms about it as if it is, but just six months ago, Biden announced his own:

<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">President Biden is directing his Trade Representative to increase tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on $18 billion of imports from China to protect American workers and businesses.</p>

<p>I calculate 2020 as being 4 years from the writing of this post, so November 2020. This is because the site linked above this footnote doesn&rsquo;t make it clear when the inflation for a year is snapshotted: is it an average over the year, is it the middle, end, start, etc.? Thus, it&rsquo;s a little hard to make consistent arguments about the relative value fluctuation over time. So, I just chose a date on the VTI graph approximately matching today&rsquo;s date.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
